    <h3>What You'll Need</h3>
    <p>This recipe shows you how to take plain, bland, store-made sauce and make it more than restaurant-worthy.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Pounds chicken breasts, cut into chunks</li>
        <li>salt and ground pepper</li>
        <li>2 packages of thin spaghetti</li>
        <li>italian seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cup of shredded parmesan</li>
        <li>2 cups chopped broccoli (optional)</li>
        <li>4 (15 ounce) jars Alfredo sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Season chicken with salt and pepper. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until no longer pink in the centers and juices run clear, 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook thin spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, add Alfredo sauce to the chicken along with Italian seasoning, garlic powder, onion, basil, salt, black pepper, onion powder, and cayenne. Bring to a slight boil; stir in Parmesan cheese. Cook mixture until cheese is melted and you are able to lift a spoon out of the sauce without cheese hanging onto it, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add broccoli, cover, and steam until tender, 2 to 6 minutes. Add broccoli to sauce.</li>
        <li>Drain cooked pasta. Scoop into individual serving bowls and pour sauce on top.</li>
        
    </ol>
